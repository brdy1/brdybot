# brdybot
This is a bot adapted from [chatbot-python-sample](https://github.com/twitchdev/chatbot-python-sample) that I use for my Twitch channel, [twitch.tv/brdy](https://www.twitch.tv/brdy).

The bot uses a PostgreSQL database with data scraped and taken from [Serebii.net](https://www.serebii.net), [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.net), [veekun](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex), and [pokemondb.net](https://pokemondb.net/).

The database is not available in this repo, but the table schema is as follows:

"pokemon"	"ability"

"pokemon"	"egggroup"

"pokemon"	"evolutiontype"

"pokemon"	"game"

"pokemon"	"gamegroup"

"pokemon"	"generation"
